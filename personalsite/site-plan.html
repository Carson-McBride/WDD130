Who We Are
Carson McBride (founder) worked for a year as an Account Executive at a recent start-up company. Wearing the many hats that come along with working at a small business alongside his exposure to other small companies in and out of the industry, he quickly realized that many small business owners understand the need to utilize social media, but don’t have the faintest clue if it isn’t directly related to their industry. Alongside small business owners, many recent graduates having grown up around social media pursued education in social media marketing but are left without work. To connect the two, Atlas Media was born. 
Acting as a gig provider for creators as well as an affordable solution to small business owners in properly utilizing social media for their business.
